### Asset Removal:
In cases where our assets are identified on any Discord server without our consent, we retain the right to submit a DMCA takedown request through Discord's trust and safety team. Such an action could result in the removal of the assets and disciplinary measures taken against the accounts involved.

### False Charge-Backs:
It is imperative to understand that chargebacks on bank platforms are not tolerated. In the event of a chargeback, the responsible party will be subject to severe consequences. This includes potential legal action taken against them. We are fully prepared to involve law enforcement authorities and, if necessary, engage the media to address any such violations.

### Content Ownership:
You are not permitted to assert ownership over any content unless it was specifically created for you on a commissioned basis.

### Content Alteration:
Without obtaining prior written authorization from a member of the Executive Staff at DiscoTech Discord Bot Services, you are not allowed to edit, modify, duplicate, or adapt any aspect of the content, whether it involves design, size, color, or format.
